# NewsVision

**Final Year Project 2024/25 â€“ NTU EEE**  
**Author:** Gan Wei Jie

## Overview

NewsVision is a layout parser designed to improve OCR accuracy on newspaper clippings by segmenting complex layouts into distinct components such as headlines, body text, images, and captions. The system uses object detection techniques to analyze and structure newspaper pages before passing them to an OCR engine. This modular approach allows for better reconstruction of original article flow and supports multiple languages.

## Features

- Image input processing for news articles  
- Text detection and extraction using OCR  
- Custom-trained layout model
- Modular OCR integration
- Debug mode to visualize bounding boxes  
- Sample outputs provided in the Output directory

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NewsVision.git
    cd NewsVision
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Optional) Install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) if you want to use the Tesseract version.

### Usage

1. Place input images in the `Input/` directory.

2. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python Code/NewsVision.py
    ```

3. Output results will be saved in the `Output/` directory.

### Debug Mode

To enable debug mode and output bounding boxes, open `Code/NewsVision.py` and set:

```python
debug_mode = True
```
### Sample Output

Example processed images and OCR results can be found in the `Output/` directory.

## Training Custom Model

1. Training was done using the tools provided by [PaddleDetection](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection/tree/release/2.8)

2. Please follow the instructions provided by PaddleDetection to train your custom model.
